Ok we are now simultaneously working on the materials costing and integrating the payment system for the accounting system @materials_closing_stock.pdf. I'm now starting another session to work on another part of the accounting system: The many small components that can be categorized. And also some codes with amounts that I don't really know where they come from. I see many of them in the trial balance. Most of them are actually labeled in @Account code documents.pdf.

1.	AC_* - ACCRUAL, the ones with amounts are AC_LEVY (LEVY_CURRENT), AC_SESB (SESB), and AC_TM (TELEKOM) . Not sure what they are, i assume they are electric bills and telekom bills.
2.	AD_* - ACCUM.DEPR-..., these are the NON-CURRENT-ASSETS of the company, they go in PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT in balance sheet, here are all the ones I spotted in the trial balance:
ACC.DEPR-FACTORY BUILDING
ACCUN.DEPR-FURNITURE & FITTING
ACCUN.DEPR-MOTOR VEHICLE
ACCUN.DEPR-OFFICE EQUIPMENT
ACC. DEPR-PARTITION AND LAND
ACCUN.DEPR-PLANT AND MACHINERY
ACCUM.DEPR-RENOVATION
ACCUM.DEPR-BUILDING (ADDITIONAL)
I think we have to implement a dedicated system for recording them too.
3.	BT* - BATTERY ..., these are all debit amounts counted into the Wages & Expenses amounts in the income statement
4.	BTRA - TRANSPORTATION, it has 10k, no idea what it is
5.	CR_* - Creditors, im not sure what these are, looks like the suppliers, I think we have to implement a system dedicated to managing this.
6.	CL_GT, CL_GF, and CL_JP, these are debits and credits from other subsidiary companies, we'll implement them later
7.	CL_TAX - TAXATION, not sure where these amounts from, they have their own row in the balance sheet
8.	CS_* we are already implementing this in the materials stock system
9.	DF_TAX - DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, no idea what this is, but it goes into ACCRUALS amounts in balance sheet
10.	HPA_* - H/P, these are HIRE PURCHASE PAYABLE HPB_* - HP INTEREST IN SUSPENSE, these are Hire Purchase Interest in Suspense. I don't really know what they are but seems like they are deeply related, I think we might have to implement a system for them too
11.	INS* - INSURANCE..., these are the insurance for cars, and they go in EXPENSES (SALARIES AND WAGES) in income statement
12.	IN_OTH - OTHER INCOME, not too sure I have to ask the staffs about this, its a credit amount and goes into its own row in the ADD section in income statement.
13.	MB*-, so this is a large section that I assume are all the expenses and wages, the debits goes into the LESS section of EXPENSES (SALARIES AND WAGES) in income statement, some items I spotted are advertisement, auditors remuneration, bank charges, cleaning expenses, donations, transportation, contribution amounts and all the salaries in the company that are generated by the @src/routes/accounting/journal-vouchers.js system. But honestly I'm considering abandoning that journal voucher system, its pretty confusing and I think we can implement a cleaner and fresher one to manage these salaries and wages amounts.
14.	NCA_*, these are again large amounts of the NCA that goes into PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT in the balance sheet too.
15.	NT_7484 - NT.213077484, no idea what this is but it has 70k amount and goes into EXPENSES (SALARIES AND WAGES)
16.	OC_* - O/CREDITOR, special creditors amounts
17.	OIL* - These are oil expenses for all the operating vehicles of the company I think
18.	OS_* - Opening stock debits, its being implemented by another agent
19.	PM_* - Packing material expenses, also implemented in the material stock pages
20.	PT* - PATCHING & TUBE/VRE-PATCHING TUBE, for cars. Amounts are pretty small and goes into EXPENSES (SALARIES AND WAGES)
21.	PU_* - These are the stock & materials purchases, they have large amounts, right now the stock management of them are being implement in the material stock system alongside the opening stock and packing materials, but the recording invoices from the suppliers and the total expenses are not really implemented yet.
22.	R* - REPAIR, repair expenses? Goes into EXPENSES (SALARIES AND WAGES)
23.	RP - RETAINED PROFIT, this has a large amount in the credit side and goes into its own row in BALANCE SHEET under FINANCED BY section
24.	SC - SHARE CAPITAL, same as RETAINED PROFIT, but lesser amount
25.	SV* - SERVICE ..., I think this is similar expenses as the R* - REPAIR, but this is service, also goes into EXPENSES (SALARIES AND WAGES) in income statement
26.	TAX* - ROAD TAX ..., This also goes into EXPENSES (SALARIES AND WAGES), same as repair and service
27.	THJ_CK - special jellypolly salary
28.	TY* - TYRE, same as repair, service, and road tax
29.	DEBTOR - large amount, I briefly explained to you before it should be in the plan already, goes into TRADE RECEIVABLES under current assets in balance sheet

So I analyzed them by order from @core_tienhock_acc_docs.pdf, I ignore all the ones without any amount, so spend time reading all these and also @docs/FRESH_ACCOUNTING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md, then let me know how you want to approach this. One important question i wanna ask is, should we keep the journal voucher system? In the old system, all these debits and credits are recorded in the journal voucher system, we have implemented in this new app, but I have strong preference for doing things from first principles and minimalism, since the old system is also from 20 years ago, I just wanna know, can we abandon the journal system, then implement entry system for each of the categories we found in the trial balance? Or are journal vouchers all needed for each items in the trial balance, thats why it was implemented this way.

Think from first principles and standard accounting/Malaysia auditing practice, let me know how should we implement the accounting system in this new ERP app
